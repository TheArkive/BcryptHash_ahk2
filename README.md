# BcryptHash_ahk2

Perform hashing of MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512.

Supports one liners, and supports fast batch hashing.  See examples.

Input is dynamically detected as a file buffer, file name, or string.

Thanks to jNizM and his [CNG lib](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=23413) for AHKv1 which provided many great examples for me getting started.

I plan to add functionality for the rest of the BCrypt suite, but it may be in another lib specifically for encryption / decryption.
